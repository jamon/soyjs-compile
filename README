Google Closure Template Javascript Compiler
- written in javascript

NOTE: this is very beta, it is nowhere near feature complete.  This is basically a proof of concept at this point.

Instructions:
$ npm install pegjs
$ node compile.js

How it works:
You will find a PEG (Parsing Expression Grammar) file in ./peg which is responsible for parsing the closure template
and returning a javascript data structure.  This .pegjs file can be compiled using the pegjs npm module, but for
simplicity, I've included a compiled version in ./soyparser.js.

compile.js is responsible for turning the parsed javascript data structure into javascript code.  The intention
thus far is to not re-use google's soy.js file, but that may be reconsidered later.
